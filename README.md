# TTC Streetcar Delays

## Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing and predicting delays in the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) streetcar network using historical incidents data from Jan 2014 to Oct 2024. The dataset, sourced from [Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-streetcar-delay-data/), contains detailed data about delays, including reasons, duration, and locations. Our goal was to understand the delays, identify key factors contributing to them, and build a regression model to predict them.

## Objectives

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**:

   - Merging excel files into a single CSV file
   - Merging duplicate columns
   
2. **Data Preprocessing and Exploration**:

   - Data type conversion
   - Handling missing values
   - Cleanup and standardize columns

4. **Descriptive Analysis**:

   - Understand the frequency and duration of delays by route, location, and time
   - Identify the most common incident types and their impact on delays

5. **Regression Analysis**:

   - Engineer new features (e.g., day of week, hour of day, season)
   - Examine correlations between variables (e.g., delay duration and gap time)
   - Develop models to predict delay duration based on gap time, hour and day of week
   - Evaluate model performance and identify key predictors of delays

## Data Science Pipeline

We followed the following steps in the Data Science pipeline process, each with a separate notebook:

1. Data Preparation (`notebooks/01_data_prep.ipynb`)
2. Data Cleaning (`notebooks/02_data_preprocessing.ipynb`)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (`notebooks/03_eda.ipynb`)
4. Descriptive and Regression Analysis (`notebooks/04_analysis.ipynb`)

## Key Findings

### Descriptive Analysis

- The **501 route** experienced the highest number of delays, with an average delay duration of 13.37 minutes.
- **Dundas West Station** was identified as a hotspot for delays with over 3,000 incidents recorded.
- Fridays had the highest number of incidents, but Sundays had the longest average delays.
- **Diversions** and **Overheads** caused the most incidents
- More than 30% of Incidents were caused by **Mechanical failures**

### Regression Analysis

- The strongest predictor of delay duration was **gap time**, with a positive correlation indicating that longer gaps lead to longer delays.
- The regression model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.88, explaining 88% of the variability in delay durations.

## Next Steps

1. Explore other modelling techniques, such as decision trees and time-series modelling
2. Analyze seasonal trends or external factors (e.g. weather conditions) that may affect delays
3. Build an interactive dashboard for monitoring and visualizing streetcar delays
